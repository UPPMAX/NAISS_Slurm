### Login info 

- You will not need a graphical user interface for this course.
- Even so, if you do not have a preferred SSH client, we recomment using <a href="https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download/" target="_blank">ThinLinc</a>

!!! important "Connection info" 

    - Login to the system you are using (Tetralith/Dardel, other Swedish HPC system)
    - Connection info for some Swedish HPC systems - use the one you have access to:
